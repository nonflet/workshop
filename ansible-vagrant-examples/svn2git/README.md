# Ansible Vagrant profile for an Svn2Git VM

## Background

Vagrant and VirtualBox (or some other VM provider) can be used to quickly build or rebuild virtual servers.

This Vagrant profile installs [Svn2Git](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) using the [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) provisioner.

With Svn2Git installed, you can convert an SVN repository to a Git repository using the command `svn-all-fast-export`. Read more here: [Switching an SVN repository to Git with KDE's Svn2Git](http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/switching-svn-repository-git2svn).

## Getting Started

This README file is inside a folder that contains a `Vagrantfile` (hereafter this folder shall be called the [vagrant_root]), which tells Vagrant how to set up your virtual machine in VirtualBox.

To use the vagrant file, you will need to have done the following:

  1. Download and Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  2. Download and Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  3. Install [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)
  4. Open a shell prompt (Terminal app on a Mac) and cd into the folder containing the `Vagrantfile`
  5. Run the following command to install the necessary Ansible roles for this profile: `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

Once all of that is done, you can simply type in `vagrant up`, and Vagrant will create a new VM, install the base box, and configure it.

Once the new VM is up and running (after `vagrant up` is complete and you're back at the command prompt), you can log into it via SSH if you'd like by typing in `vagrant ssh`.
